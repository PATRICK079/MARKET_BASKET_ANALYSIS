# Introduction

Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.

Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data and are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures of interestingness, based on the concept of strong rules.

# Business problem

 Following the valuable insights and recommendations which I provided from my previous customer segmentation analysis-specifically regarding premium customers who are high spenders and high-income customers who are low spenders—the company is now looking to further optimize its sales strategy. the company aims to increase sales and enhance customer retention. To achieve this, They’ve planned to implement targeted promotional campaigns  and loyalty packages as I have recommended. 

Now, they  require expertise in analyzing their  historical sales data to identify associations between store items. By understanding their  item associations, they can optimize store layout and tailor loyalty programs to encourage additional purchases among high spenders. The goal is to leverage these insights to strategically arrange products and design personalized loyalty offerings that boost sales and strengthen customer loyalty.
